# Compact Neural Network via Stacking Hybrid Units
This is the source code for our TPAMI paper: Compact Neural Network via Stacking Hybrid Units
It provides some examples of how to build networks with designed basic units based on Pytorch. The version that supports more models is coming soon.

## Part I: Exploration on Basic Units
MNIST:
```bash
$ python mnist.py
```
CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100:
```bash
$ python train_cifar.py
```
## Part II: Main Experiments
CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100:
```bash
$ python train.py
```
